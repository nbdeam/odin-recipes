    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>

    <img src="../res/spaghetti-bolognese.jpeg">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ol>
